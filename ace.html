  <h1>Welcome to dragons Academy</h1>
  <p>Learn to swim like a pro with us!</p> 
  <div style="text-align:left;margin:30px;color:#00796b">
    <p><strong>why dragons academy</strong></p>
    <p><strong> because dragons academy guarantees you that you will improve over time,whether it is in the tactic or the numbers that you will achieve</strong></p>
    <p><strong> what are the main categories of swimming </strong></p>
    <p><ol type="1"> there are two main categories of it<li>free swimming</li>
    <li> fins swimming </li>    
    </ol></p>
    <p><strong> what are the categories of fins swimming </strong></p>
    <p><ol type="1"> fins swimming have  two types
        <li> is swimming with double fins in it we move our arms alternately:one arm pulls underwater while the other recovers over the water and kick our legs with quick,strong kicks from the hips both at the same time</li>
    <li> monofin swimming in it we use a single large fin instead of two seperate fins,your legs stay together and you move your entire body in a wave-like motion (from head to toes),there is no separate kicking with the legs like in normal swimming:it's a full body undulation</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>what are the categories of free swimming</strong></p>
    <p><ol type="1">free swimming have four categories
        <li> free swimming its like double fins style but with out fins its the same way exactly in it we breath from our side </li>
        <li>back stroke  its like the free swimming and double fins but we swim by our back</li>
        <li>breaststroke in it both arms move outward and then sweep back together underneath your body,
            your legs preform a frog kick:pull your heels towards your body.then push them backward strongly
        your body stays close to the water surface most of the time 
        you breathe when you lift your head up after the arm pull and kick 
        breaststroke is slower than other strokes but very energy-efficient and comfortable.
        </li>
        <li> butterfly swimming in it both arms move together: you stretch them forward,then pull them down and back under your body 
        your body creates a wave like motion with each stroke 
        both legs kick together using a dolphin kick motion 
        you breathe when you lift your head above the water during the arm recovery 
        it requires strong coordination between the arms,legs,and body.    
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><ol type="1">what are the equipments we use 
     <li>swimming glass</li>
     <li>swimming cap</li>
     <li>snorkel but this one we use in fins swimming only</li> 
     <li>swimming trunks</li>
     <li>hand paddles we wear it in our hand this we use if we beginners and if we free swimmers</li>
     <li>ball boys like hand paddles too we put it between our legs to dont make them move if we need to focus in our arms tactic </li>
     <li>kickboard</li>
    </ol>
